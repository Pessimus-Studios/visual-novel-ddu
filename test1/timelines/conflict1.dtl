The two of you continue to walk for a long time.
Your conversations together would be a bit of the same.
But, of course, as any road trip goes... There is a point when you run out of things to talk about.
Walking quietly was fine, too. That wasn't an issue.
mrC: We're gettin' close. Hold yer horses...! Patience. And ye shall be rewarded.
Mr. C looks around cautiously. You couldn't help but notice that it got a little darker.
A part of you starts to doubt if you'll ever return.
You'd notice that the sun contines to lower. Mr. C seems to get a little uneasy, and turns his attention to you.
You start to wonder if you're going the right way.
What if Mr. C. doesn't know where he's going?
What if you're getting further away?
