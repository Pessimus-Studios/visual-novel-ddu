You decide to ask about Mr. C.
He raises an eyebrow in response.
mrC (huh): ...Who am I?
mrC: ...
mrC: Don't you want to know where you are?
He raises an eyebrow. He doesn't seem offended by the question, but rather a little confused.
mrC (neutral): I'm just the Guide! I guide ya. Somethin' like that!
mrC: It's not so deep. Don't you worry!
mrC: You shake your head, and give him a little nudge. There had to have been something that he wanted to tell you.
mrC: ...This is a first... I don't know- I'm just Mr. C! That's what everyone's called me. I liked it. It gives people a name! Someone called me that a long time ago. I just stuck with it. It puts a name to the face!
mrC: I stay while others go. I make sure everyone gets home safely. But! I cannot say much. It defeats the purpose! This is your journey! I cannot spoil anything...
He adjusts his cloak.
mrC: I get to meet all kinds of people... I am the Gatekeeper of the Road! The one with the keys, yeah?
mrC: I make sure you don't lose yourself on the Road... It has an affect on people!
mrC: When I found you there, in the Forest... You looked so lost! Everyone looks like that. Trust me. Bad thing, to get lost.
mrC: Satisfied?
