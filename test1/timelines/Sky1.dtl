update mrC (neutral) center
You ask him about the fall. The sky. The path above? It didn't quite make sense to you.
Not that any of this made sense in the first place.
update mrC (huh)
Mr. C. doesn't answer. He rubs the back of his head, and look off to the side.
mrC: Well... Path above... It's just a theory of mine.
mrC (neutral): Everyone who comes here are a bit the same."
mrC (huh): They all have the same problem.
mrC (sad): Telling you would really, really ruin it. I can only hope you don't put two-n'-two together, cap-i-tan. Else, you may not make it.
mrC (neutral): I can only help you so much...
mrC: Up there! Different. Brighter? Maybe. Noisy? I'd think so.
mrC: One day... Everyone. Boom-! Down here they go. Down to me!
mrC: Well- Not [shake]splat[/shake], but you get the idea.
mrC: Perhaps you can't die here. But I wouldn't test it!
mrC (singing1): On the Road again...~
mrC (neutral): It's not so bad. I haven't had that much trouble... I believe in you!
mrC: You're not alone here, cap-i-tan.
mrC: I can only take you to the end of the Road, though.
He shrugs.
mrC (sad): Of course, I could be wrong about all of it! Maybe I'm just a character in your dream, eh?
He titters nervously. 
mrC (neutral): That means I'm not real... I'd like to think that I am!
