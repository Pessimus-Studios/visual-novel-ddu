You ask him about himself. You figure that, he knows what he's doing.
While you don't understand where you are, and where he's bringing you, you trust that he knows where you want to go.
mrC (huh): ...Who am I?
mrC: ...
mrC: Don't you want to know where you are?
He raises an eyebrow. He doesn't seem offended by the question, but rather a little confused.
mrC (glasses): I'm just the Guide! I guide ya. Somethin' like that!
mrC (neutral): It's not so deep. Don't you worry!
You shake your head, and give him a little nudge. There had to have been something that he wanted to tell you.
mrC (glasses): ...This is a first... I don't know- I'm just Mr. C! That's what everyone's called me.
mrC (neutral): I liked it. It gives people a name! Someone called me that a long time ago. I just stuck with it. It puts a name to the face!
mrC: I stay while others go. I make sure everyone gets home safely. But! I cannot say much. It defeats the purpose! This is your journey! I cannot spoil anything...
He adjusts his cloak.
mrC: I get to meet all kinds of people... I am the Gatekeeper of the Road! The one with the keys, yeah?
mrC: I make sure you don't lose yourself on the Road... It has an affect on people!
mrC: When I found you there, in the Forest... You looked so lost! Everyone looks like that. Trust me. Bad thing, to get lost.
mrC: Satisfied?
