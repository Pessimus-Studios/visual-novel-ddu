An aching pain is present.
A pain soars throughout your whole body. It feels as if you were only asleep for a few minutes, but a part of your subconscious tells you that you are very, very far away.
The sound of rustling leaves, the smell of bark, and the dry dirt surface underneath you. Definitely not where you fell asleep. This wasn't your room.

You get up, and take in your surroundings. A forest, stretching far off into the distance. The sight alone makes you a little dizzy. Uncomfortable. Nervous.
You pick yourself up from the ground. It was quiet. Far too quiet. You try to take a step forward, but you feel locked in place.
do GameManager.enable_desaturation()
Every time you look around, it's as if the forest is constantly changing and shifting.

mrCwhat: Hey, you there!
You see a man, off in the distance. He calls to you. A friendly voice, but you feel at unease. You still don't know where you are.
mrCwhat: Hey! Can you even hear me?
He approaches, with an awkward way of running.
If there were any obstacles, he would probably have fallen over by now.
He comes off as a bit... Of a weirdo.
You start to take a few steps back.
"No, wait wait! I'll be right with you!"

- Wait
	leave simon [animation="Instant Out" length="0.0"]
	He continues to stumble as he walks. It looks like he has been running for a long time.
	As he approaches, it's clear that he's injured his knee at some point while making his way over to you, given the slight limp.
	...He seems a bit scatterbrained. But, friendly. You entertain him and wait, by standing still.
	It was almost comical.
- Flee
	leave simon [animation="Instant Out" length="0.0"]
	You didn't trust him. Not at all. You stumbled back, but every step you took backwards made you feel nervous.
	It was as if the Forest was reacting negatively to your actions. You would feel a burning headache in your head, but as you turn to look at him...
	He didn't seem like much of the attacking type. You keep your arms up in case he were to try something, but...
	The purple cloak wasn't very menacing. He was also shorter than you.
- Attack
	leave simon [animation="Instant Out" length="0.0"]
	You put your arms up in anticipation. Something about this guy seemed dodgy. You get into your stance, getting ready for whatever he would do.
	He slows down for a moment and raises his arms.
	Wait, wait...!
	...Something about him makes him very unthreatening.
	Perhaps it was a better idea to hear him out first.
	You slowly lower your arms, but you stay cautious of the man as he approaches.
- Judge
	leave simon [animation="Instant Out" length="0.0"]
	You raise an eyebrow and cross your arms as you watch him approach.
	[shake]What a weirdo...[/shake]
	He stumbles his way towards you. Perhaps he has an injured knee. Or, perhaps he wasn't all there. He seemed friendly enough for you to wait.
