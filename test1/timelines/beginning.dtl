An aching pain is present.
It feels as if you only slept for a few minutes, yet you feel as if you are very, very far away...
The sound of rustling leaves, the smell of bark, and the dry dirt surface underneath you. Definitely not where you fell asleep.

You get up, and take in your surroundings. A forest, stretching far off into the distance. The sight alone makes you a little dizzy.
mrCwhat: Hey, you there!
You see a man, off in the distance. He calls to you. A friendly voice, but you feel at unease. You still don't know where you are.
You fell asleep on your desk, after a long day. Waking up in the middle of nowhere is bound to make anyone feel uneasy, no matter the circumstances.
mrCwhat: Hey! Can you even hear me?
He approaches, with an awkward running style. He runs as if he is covered in mud, and as if he is trying his best not to get it everywhere. Despite this, he is clean.
He comes off as a bit... Of a weirdo.
You start to take a few steps back.
mrCwhat: No, wait wait! I'll be right with you!
You stop, and wait. Even if he was a threat, he didn't seem like much of one.

mrCwhat: "Phew..."
mrCwhat: Greetings, traveller! I watched ya arrive! You had quite the fall!
mrC: My name is Mr. C. But you can call me... Mr. C!

mrC: I watched you fall from the sky. I thought... Some kinda bird, there! I looked closely and, it wan' no bird! It was a human!
mrC: But seriously, how'd ya survive that? That must'a hurt!
mrC: Ah, that's besides the point.
mrC: You may be wondering where you are. To be honest, I  wonder the same thing... I just call this place the Forest! You're quite a ways away from the Road, but no worries!
...Huh?
mrC: I can take you there. Come, please! I'll tell you all about it.
...What is going on?
While every fiber of your being is against it, a small part of you tries to convince yourself to follow this strange man. His purple cloak clings idly on him, so unmoving that it's enough for you to notice the lack of wind.
You hesitate for a moment, of course. However, as you glance around, and back toward the endless stretch of trees behind you... You see that you do not have much of a choice. An endless sea of lines, the shadows casted by the slender trees, and the crepuscular rays shining through the gaps.
Mr. C watches you inquisitively as you hesitate. He has an unwavering grin. While his eagerness is intimidating, his actions are void of malice.
You follow.

[shake]...Where am I?[/shake]
You decide to ask the question.
join mrC left [animation="Slide In Left"]
mrC: I was just about to get to it! Ya see... I didn't want to scare you, but I'm not so sure either. However, I think you'll find me to be the best guide around, seein' as there isn't anyone else who knows the place as good as I do.
mrC: The Forest is a place where people fall to every now and again. From all walks of life! Many'a people come and go... I've just been 'round here! I guide others to a treasure I cannot possess, you can say!
Mr. C gently hums as he walks, between speaking.
mrC: This place has been a home of mine for many many years! Eheheh... I've helped people like you my whole life! The Forest. The Road! I am the Gatekeeper. I am the guide! You are the cap-i-tan, I am the grease in the elbow, the caviar with the wine!
A gentle chuckle escapes your lips as you think about the names. "The Forest", "The Road".
mrC: What's so funny, eh?

	You remind him that you still have no idea where you are, and are a little confused with it all.
	mrC: Ahh, come on... It's not a problem! I'll show ya. The Road is where everyone goes, no matter what!
	(Mr. C will remember that.)
	mrC: The Forest! The Road! Or was it The Path...
	Mr. C looks off to the side for a moment, and his pace slows down. It seems as if he is in deep thought.
	This doesn't last longer than a few seconds. He springs back to life, and speeds up his walking.
	mrC: We should get a move on! It's best not to stay here... The woods can easily take over one's mind!
	The walk through the forest is calm. So calm... The sun rays are unmoving, fixed in a position, as if this world had no concept of time.
	Maybe the lack of moving time has an affect on people. You wonder if he is truly alone here, or if he simply forgets the people he meets. Come to think of it, the whole forest feels the same.
	Turning around, you can barely recognize where you've come from, as if you have already walked a few kilometers, yet you've barely walked one.
	After some walking, you see it in the distance. Artificial terrain.

	You tell him that his naming convention is very rudimentary.
	mrC: Daah, that's the whole point of it! You forget things, now and again... Being here for too long can even make you forget your name.
	(Mr. C will remember that.)
	mrC: The Forest! The Road! Or was it The Path...

	You say that his naming convention is a bit stupid.
	He looks at you skeptically, and doesn't say much.
	(Mr. C will remember that.)
	mrC: What's the problem with that? It's simple! Nice and simple, eh?

- Joke
	leave simon [animation="Instant In" length="0.0"]
	update mrC left [move_time="0.5"]
	You say that, he must call his home "The House".
	...
	(Mr. C will remember that.)
	He gives you an awkward chuckle, rubbing the back of his head.
	...
	mrC: ...Hah! I get it now!
	His face lights up, after understanding the joke.
	mrC: I think we'll get along just fine! Heheh!
	mrC: Alright, alright! We should get a move on! It's best not to stay here... The woods can easily take over one's mind!
	Perhaps it's best not to try being funny.*
