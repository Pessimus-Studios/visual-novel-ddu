It's warm.
The sounds of a crackling campfire. You couldn't mistake it for anything else.
You see him gently poking some sticks around, making sure that the fire doesn't die.
He sees you, stirring awake.
A gasp is heard as he approaches.

mrC: You! Traveller!

mrC: Welcome back! I was thinking you'd never wake up...
mrC: You may be in a little bit of pain...
mrC: You were struck by a falling branch right after you pulled me out of that rubble.
mrC: But, you're fine! We are immortal here. You've just been knocked out.
mrC: We'll get to where we need to go soon. Don't you worry. Patience, my friend.
mrC: The Storm... I apologize. If I had known it would be so bad, I would've told you.
mrC: Had I known you were doing so bad... I would've warned you of the Storm.
mrC: But it's okay now.
mrC: You're okay.
mrC: You should've run! You shouldn'a turned around...
mrC: But thank you.
mrC: Really.
mrC: That Storm was the worst I've ever seen...
mrC: ...Would you like to talk about it?
You tell him that you're fine.
Mr. C gives you a hug.
[shake]... [/shake]
It was time to move forwards.
