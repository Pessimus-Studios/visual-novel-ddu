	Having already walked for some time, you notice that you've been walking a little faster than him, and that he's started to lag behind.
	You slow your pace down slightly to match his.
	You reassure him that it's okay. It's okay not to know everything.
	You and Mr. C. were in this together. You told him that you were happy with a guide in general.
	A smile plasters his face.
	mrC: Hey, hey! I'm the guide here, ya know! I'm the one to help. You just sit tight, cap-i-tan. Follow my lead. We will get there!
	mrC: I've been the guide to this world for as long as I can remember!
	mrC: I've helped many'a people come and go...
	mrC: ...And i'll be the one to help you.
	mrC: Don't worry about ol' me!
	mrC: Let's get a move on!
	mrC: I am Mr. C! I am the Guide! The Gatekeeper of The Road!
	He starts to pick up the pace a little, raising his hand up and motioning for you to follow.
	He starts to hum as he walks again, with a light swing in his step.
	mrC: It gets quiet here... People don't come very often! Time doesn't move very fast here... Come to think of it, time only moves when people are around!
	Mr. C. looks at you inquisitively as you walk with him.
	He turns his body a little bit to you as you walk.
	mrC: ...I see that look in yer eyes... Ask, ask!
	mrC: I'm willing to answer! Nobody's wanted to ask me a question before!
- Insist
	leave simon
	You double down, and continue to ask him about the Forest. Where exactly were you? You needed answers, and now.
	mrC: I ehh... Already told you as much as I know about the Forest. Really. It's the outskirts of the Road. Not sure what else to say...
	mrC: ...
	Mr. C. looks a little down.
	He doesn't seem to want to talk to you, at the moment.

- Start singing
	leave mainCharacter
	You don't like the silence. Not one bit. A once cheery guide of yours, now silent.
	[shake]Lived a man, who sailed the sea...[/shake]
	You continue one of his songs, one that he was singing earlier.
	His face lights up. He continues.
	mrC: ...And he told us of his life...~
	mrC: Yeah, yeah! Ye'r gettin' it! Eheheh...!
	He cackles to himself, as he chimes in. His voice is reanimated once more, as a smile forms on his lips.
	He starts to pick up the pace a little, raising his hand up and motioning for you to follow.
	You couldn't help it, as you also cracked a smile. There was something about his carefree style.
	He starts to hum as he walks again, with a light swing in his step.
	mrC: It gets quiet here... People don't come very often! Time doesn't move very fast here... Come to think of it, time only moves when people are around!
	Mr. C. looks at you inquisitively as you walk with him.
	He turns his body a little bit to you as you walk.
	mrC: ...I see that look in yer eyes... Ask, ask!
	mrC: I'm willing to answer! Nobody's wanted to ask me a question before!
	It seems as if he could tell that you wanted to ask a question.
	It wouldn't hurt to ask something.

- About yourself
	leave simon
	You glance down as you walk with him. The silence wasn't ideal.
	Perhaps it was time to say something about yourself.
	You tell him about what you remember just before meeting him.
	You don't say much at first, of course. You aren't sure how exactly you'd put it into words.
	You decide to tell him a bit about yourself.
	You tell him your name. You tell him where your from.
	mrC: Oh? Not sure how surprising it is, but I've heard that name before.
	mrC: That's always interesting.
	In return, Mr. C looks off into the distance.
	He shakes it off.
	mrC: So, friend! Any uh... Any questions? Any at all! I wouldn't mind ansswering them.
