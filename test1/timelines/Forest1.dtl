	mrC: It's safe to say that you are here for the same reason as everyone else. There are other people, just like you! Some fall a bit further up the Road, some fall a bit further down...
	mrC: At least people don't land on the Road! Not that I think you even can...
	mrC: There is a path. Above this. Perhaps you have come from there, and you've strayed too far off of yours. This, cap-i-tan, is my best guess.
	mrC: But it seems that everyone who comes down here comes from their sleep! I have yet to meet anyone who says they fall wide awake. I- Eheheh... I'm not so sure, really...
	He looks down, as if he is a little bit lost himself.
	A wave of silence comes. Perhaps it was time to say something.
	Having already walked for some time, you notice that you've been walking a little faster than him, and that he's started to lag behind.
	You slow your pace down slightly to match his.
	You reassure him that it's okay. It's okay not to know everything.
	You and Mr. C. were in this together. You told him that you were happy with a guide in general.
	A smile plasters his face.
	mrC: Hey, hey! I'm the guide here, ya know! I'm the one to help. You just sit tight, cap-i-tan. Follow my lead. We will get there!
	mrC: I've been the guide to this world for as long as I can remember!
	mrC: I've helped many'a people come and go...
	mrC: ...And i'll be the one to help you.
	mrC: Don't worry about ol' me!
	mrC: Let's get a move on!
	mrC: I am Mr. C! I am the Guide! The Gatekeeper of The Road!
	He starts to pick up the pace a little, raising his hand up and motioning for you to follow.
	He starts to hum as he walks again, with a light swing in his step.
	mrC: It gets quiet here... People don't come very often! Time doesn't move very fast here... Come to think of it, time only moves when people are around!
	Mr. C. looks at you inquisitively as you walk with him.
	He turns his body a little bit to you as you walk.
	mrC: ...I see that look in yer eyes... Ask, ask!
	mrC: I'm willing to answer! Nobody's wanted to ask me a question before!

	You double down, and continue to ask him about the Forest. Where exactly were you? You needed answers, and now.
