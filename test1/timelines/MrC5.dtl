mrC (neutral): Ya see, people only fall here every so often... The Road is long! I make sure I don't miss anyone. But... It's not like people fall every day!
mrC: Time doesn't quite pass in the same way as you think, here...
mrC (huh): At least, from what I've gathered.

mrC: Havin' some company is always accepted!
